## CLAUDE.md

1. Implement the code as simple as possible.
1. Read .claude/docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md and .claude/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for existing coding standards and architecture of codebase and follow existing coding rules.


### Test Data and Examples

1. Do not use specific examples from user's actual data in unit tests, code, or comments.
1. Use general or common examples instead (e.g., use common idioms like "break the ice" or "lose one's temper" rather than specific expressions from user's notebooks).


### README.md

1. Keep README.md up-to-date for an end user, not for a developer
